Snowflake Service Consumption Table
Effective: April 1, 2026
Consumption
Generally. The Snowflake Service is a cloud data platform provided by Snowflake (“Snowflake”, “we”, “us”, “our”) to Snowflake customers (each a
“Customer”, “you”, “your”) as a service which consumes resources for distinct functions as set forth herein and is available in several different editions
(“Editions”) and hosted in different geographical regions (“Regions”) by certain third-party cloud providers (“Cloud Providers”), as described more fully in
your agreement with Snowflake (“Agreement”) and the Documentation. Customer Data is uploaded into Customer’s account on the Snowflake Service
(“Account”) and may be stored in a central repository in each Account (“Storage”). Customer can create and manage virtual warehouses (each, a “Virtual
Warehouse”) or Snowpark container services compute nodes (“Compute Nodes”) as needed to combine and process Customer Data from Storage
(respectively, “Virtual Warehouse Services” and “SPCS Compute”). As set forth in the tables below “Azure,” “AWS,” and “GCP” each refer to the Cloud
Providers, Microsoft Corporation, Amazon Web Services, Inc., and Google LLC, respectively. Any ($) values set forth in the below tables are in U.S. dollars
(USD).
Snowflake Credits
Compute (Virtual Warehouse Services, SPCS Compute, Snowflake Openflow, and Postgres Compute). Snowflake bills for Compute using
purchasable credits, as described herein (“Snowflake Credits” or “Credits”). Virtual Warehouses and Compute Nodes (which includes Postgres
Compute) use Snowflake Credits at certain rates based on the effective size1 of the Virtual Warehouse or Compute Node while the applicable
Virtual Warehouse or Compute Node is in operation, as set forth in the Snowflake Credit Tables below, as determined by Customer. When a
Virtual Warehouse or Compute Node is suspended, it does not use any Snowflake Credits. Unless otherwise noted, when a Virtual Warehouse
or a Postgres Compute Node is started or resumed, a minimum of one minute’s worth of Snowflake Credits will be consumed; when an Interactive
Warehouse (a type of Virtual Warehouse) is started or resumed, a minimum of sixty (60) minutes’ worth of Snowflake Credits will be consumed;
when a Compute Node (except for Postgres Compute) is started or resumed, a minimum of five minutes’ worth of Snowflake Credits will be
consumed. Thereafter, Virtual Warehouses and Compute Nodes will be charged on a per second basis, rounded up to the nearest whole second.
For Snowflake Openflow Compute, Snowflake Credits will be charged on a per second basis with a 60-second minimum.
Cloud Services.2 Operating the Snowflake Service requires the use of the Snowflake cloud services layer (“Cloud Services”). Cloud Services is
charged based on the amount of Cloud Services compute resources used while operating the Snowflake Service. You will be charged 4.4 Credits
per hour of Cloud Services use. Your daily use of Cloud Services will not incur any charges if the daily Snowflake Credits charged for such use
is less than or equal to 10% of the daily Snowflake Credits consumed for use of Virtual Warehouse Services (“Cloud Services Adjustment”).
Cloud Services usage associated with: (i) Serverless Features (as described below); or (ii) SPCS Compute do not contribute to the Cloud Services
Adjustment.
Serverless Features. Snowflake offers a number of Serverless Features as described in the Documentation. Serverless Features operate on
Snowflake-managed compute resources which are charged by the number of Compute-Hours used to operate the Serverless Feature. One
“Compute-Hour” is defined as the computing resources comparable to running an XS Virtual Warehouse for one hour. In the event Snowflake
uses computing resources that are equivalently larger or smaller than an XS Virtual Warehouse, the Credit consumption rate will be adjusted
accordingly. For example, if a Serverless Feature uses computing resources comparable to an S Virtual Warehouse for 30 minutes, such use is
measured as one Compute-Hour. Compute-Hours are calculated on a per second basis, rounded up to the nearest whole second. For Serverless
Features, Snowflake-managed compute is billed at the rate of one Credit per Compute-Hour, multiplied by the applicable feature multiplier in
Table 5. Some Serverless Features also incur Cloud Service charges, which are also multiplied by the applicable feature multiplier in Table 5.
Some Serverless Features also incur Unit Charges. The Serverless Feature charges for Snowflake-managed compute resources, Cloud
Services, and Unit Charges appear in the usage statement as a single line item for that Serverless Feature.
AI Features. Snowflake additionally offers artificial intelligence features that run on Snowflake-managed compute resources (“Snowflake AI
Features”). Snowflake AI Features bill at the rates set forth in Table 6. “Token” refers to each smallest unit of text processed by the model
powering the Snowflake AI Feature. The conversion rate of raw input or output text into Tokens can vary depending on the Cortex model, as
further described in the Documentation. Where a feature bills on Tokens, the charge is based on the total number of Tokens processed, which
may include only input Tokens or both input and output Tokens, as described in the Documentation. In some cases, Snowflake AI Features bill
based on the amount of compute time spent to complete a job, or on the units processed. Snowflake AI Features may bill based on purchasable
units, as described in Table 2 (“AI Credits”). When a price is listed per-quantity, such as AI Credits per 1 million tokens or per 1,000 messages,
you will be billed proportionally for all units used, not only in whole-quantity increments. The amount of compute time billed may be normalized
based on the types of compute used.
Data Sharing Features and Rebate Program. As described in the Documentation, Snowflake offers you the ability to use Data Sharing Features
to (1) share the data in your account with other Snowflake customers and/or users, including via read-only accounts (“Reader Accounts”) and
(2) access or use data from other Snowflake customers (provided your usage data may be provided to such Snowflake customers). You will pay
for all usage by Reader Accounts. Your Snowflake Credit usage may be offset by Credits issued under the Snowflake Collaboration Rebate
Program (“Rebate Program”). Please read the applicable Collaboration Rebate Terms made available at https://www.snowflake.com/en/legal/
(the “Rebate Terms”) that describe the Rebate Program. The Rebate Terms may have changed since you last read them. By accepting any
benefits under the Rebate Program, including any Credits you earn through the Rebate Program, you accept the Rebate Terms. If you do not
agree to be bound by the Rebate Terms, you may not participate in the Rebate Program and must opt out of the Rebate Program by contacting
Snowflake at legalnotices@snowflake.com.
Storage. Storage pricing is based on the average terabytes per month of all Customer Data stored in your Snowflake Account. The average terabytes per
month is calculated by taking periodic snapshots of all Customer Data. The daily average will be displayed in the Snowflake Service. The monthly charge
is based on the average calculated across the number of calendar days in that month. If Customer Data stored is compressed, the compressed file size is
used in the calculation of the total storage used. The applicable storage pricing for each feature is set forth in Tables 3(a), 3(b), 3(c), 3(d), 3(e), and 3(f)
below, as described further in the Documentation.
Data Transfer (Ingress or Egress): As more fully described in the Documentation, the Snowflake Service allows Customer to transfer Customer Data in
and out of its existing Account (“Data Transfer”). Depending on the Cloud Provider and what Region the Data Transfer is executed from, charges may be
incurred for the Data Transfer. In addition, SPCS Compute can incur Data Transfer costs when transferring data between compute components (“SPCS
Data Transfer”). On a daily basis, any charges for SPCS Data Transfer will be adjusted down by an amount equal to the lower of: (i) your cost incurred
1 If you have the ability to create multi-cluster Virtual Warehouses, each Virtual Warehouse can run multiple, equal-size clusters concurrently and
independently. The rate of Snowflake Credits charged for a multi-cluster Virtual Warehouse is calculated by multiplying the rate for the size of the Virtual
Warehouse and the number of running clusters.
2 Accounts in Capacity will be charged for Cloud Services only if it has a Subscription Term Start Date on or after February 1, 2020.

that day for SPCS Data Transfers; or (ii) 10% of your cost incurred that day for SPCS Compute. The charges applicable to a Data Transfer for each Cloud
Provider are set forth in Tables 4(a), 4(b), and 4(c) below. As described in the Documentation, some features (e.g., External Functions) may have
alternate data transfer charges, as set forth below.

While in On Demand, your Snowflake Credit pricing is as set forth in Table 2(a) (On Demand Credit Pricing). Capacity Credit Pricing is based on applying
the Snowflake Credit Discount in your Order Form to the On Demand Credit Price for the applicable Cloud Provider, Region, and Edition. For clarity, the
Snowflake Credit Discount does not apply to AI Credit Pricing in Table 2(b) or Storage Pricing in Table 3(a) below. Purchased Capacity may be applied
toward any of your Accounts on the Snowflake Service. Snowflake will provide you with monthly statements of usage, in arrears.

While in On Demand, your Snowflake AI Credit Pricing is as set forth in the “On Demand AI Credit Pricing” column in this Table 2(b) (AI Credit Pricing).
Capacity AI Credit Pricing is determined by the tier corresponding to the average annualized Capacity value (“ACV”) in the applicable Order Form, except
as otherwise indicated on such Order Form. The ACV ranges in this Table 2(b) and their associated Capacity AI Credit Pricing apply by default, but any
different tier(s) for Capacity AI Credit Pricing and/or Capacity AI Credit Pricing stated in the applicable Order Form will control. For clarity and the avoidance
of doubt, Additional Capacity Orders and any unused but paid for Capacity carried over from prior Order Forms are not included when determining the
applicable ACV tier.

While in On Demand, your Storage Pricing is as set forth in the “On Demand Storage Pricing” column in this Table 3(a) (Standard Storage Pricing). For any
Order Form designated as a “Qualifying Order” by its express written terms, as of the Order Form Effective Date of such Qualifying Order, the Capacity
Storage Pricing” for Accounts procured thereunder shall be the applicable adjusted Capacity Storage Pricing indicated in such Qualifying Order, based upon
the “Capacity Storage Tier” and the respective Snowflake Service Edition(s), Region(s) and Cloud Provider(s) procured under such Qualifying Order. This
Table 3(a) is for illustrative purposes only and the Qualifying Order will control over any conflict. Absent any express terms to the contrary in the applicable
Order Form or Agreement, the Capacity Storage Price for Accounts procured under Order Forms not expressly designated as a “Qualifying Order” shall be
based on the “Tier 1” rates in Table 3(a) above. For clarity, Additional Capacity Orders and any unused but previously purchased Capacity carried over from
prior Order Forms are not included when determining the applicable ACV tier.
For clarity, any references to “storage” (e.g., “Capacity Storage Price,” “Capacity Storage Tier(s),” or “Storage Discount(s)”) indicated on an Order Form
shall be understood in reference to the Standard Storage Pricing set forth in Table 3(a), and not in reference to any other storage type set forth below.

10 File charge doesn't apply to Iceberg tables, only to External Tables and Directory Tables.
11 The ROW_COUNT DMF (as described further in the Documentation) uses a Snowflake-managed compute multiplier of 0.9.
12 Charges for Logging will soon be replaced with charges for Telemetry Data Ingest.
13 This feature is available free of charge for a limited period of time.
14 Text-based files (e.g. CSV, XML, JSON) will be charged for their uncompressed size. Binary-based files (e.g., Parquet, Avro, ORC) will be charged for
their observed size regardless of compression.
15 Charges for Snowpipe Streaming only apply to the new high performance architecture.
16 Charges for Snowpipe Streaming Classic only apply to the classic architecture (ingest-java SDK versions 4.X or older).

A Provisioned Throughput reservation allows you to reserve continuous access to certain Snowflake AI Features for a specified, fixed term (the “Provisioned
Throughput”), subject to Snowflake’s approval. Each Provisioned Throughput must specify: (i) the reserved Snowflake AI Feature; (ii) the term; (iii) and the
number of requested provisioned throughput units (“PTUs”), as described further in the Documentation. You will consume Credits for the Provisioned
Throughput throughout the term regardless of your actual usage of the reserved Snowflake AI Feature. Provisioned Throughput is non-cancellable, non-
transferable, non-resellable, non-exchangeable, non-modifiable, non-refundable and non-renewable. Provisioned Throughput does not renew automatically.

Additional Accounts. You may request additional Accounts through the Snowflake Service or by filing a support ticket. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you
may be required to sign an Order Form to add new VPS accounts.
Non-U.S. Order Forms. Customer is responsible for all Taxes associated with its purchases or use of, or access to, the Snowflake offerings. If Snowflake
has the legal obligation to pay or collect such Taxes, Snowflake will invoice Customer and Customer will pay that amount unless Customer provides
Snowflake with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. Taxes will not be deducted from payments to Snowflake,
except as required by applicable law, in which case Customer will increase the amount payable as necessary so that, after making all required deductions
and withholdings, Snowflake receives and retains (free from any liability for Taxes) an amount equal to the amount it would have received had no such
deductions or withholdings been made. Upon Snowflake’s request, Customer will provide to Snowflake its proof of withholding tax remittance to the
respective tax authority. Where applicable, Customer will provide its VAT/GST Registration Number(s) on the Order Form to confirm the business use of

the purchased services. As used here, "Taxes" means taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, any
sales, use, GST, value-added, withholding, or similar taxes, whether domestic or foreign, or assessed by any jurisdiction, but excluding any taxes based on
net income, property, or employees of Snowflake.
Currency Conversions. Customer’s consumption pursuant to this Snowflake Service Consumption Table will be measured in U.S. Dollars (“USD”). If an
Order Form requires payment in a currency other than USD (“Foreign Currency”) and specifies the Capacity Credit Price and the Capacity Storage Price
in USD, Customer’s invoice(s) will be payable to Snowflake in such Foreign Currency pursuant to the payment obligations set forth in the Order Form and
further subject to the following:
1. If Customer is in On Demand:
a. For each invoice, Customer’s consumption for the invoiced period will be converted from USD to the relevant Foreign
Currency at the Spot Rate21 applicable for the last day of the invoiced period.
b. Customer will receive a monthly statement reflecting its consumption for the immediately preceding month in USD.
2. If Customer has available Capacity:
a. Customer’s total Capacity commitment specified in the Order Form will be converted from Foreign Currency to USD at the
Spot Rate applicable for the Processing Date22 under such Order Form (“USD Total Capacity Balance”).
b. In the event Customer has eligible Capacity Rollover in EUR from a Prior Order Form, any such Capacity Rollover will be
converted to USD at the Spot Rate applicable for the Processing Date of the renewal Order Form and such amount shall be added to
the USD Total Capacity Balance.
c. In the event of an Additional Capacity Order to an existing Capacity Order Form (“Underlying Order Form”), Customer’s
total Capacity commitment specified in such Additional Capacity Order will be converted from Foreign Currency to USD at the Spot
Rate then-applicable for the Underlying Order Form and will be added to the aggregate USD Total Capacity Balance covering both
the Underlying Order Form and the Additional Capacity Order.
d. Each invoice issued to Customer under the Order Form constitutes a “Billing Event” and the following shall apply with
respect to each Billing Event:
i. Customer’s Capacity payment obligation amount in connection with each Billing Event will be converted from
Foreign Currency to USD at the Spot Rate applicable for the invoice date of each Billing Event; and
ii. At the time of each Billing Event, the USD Total Capacity Balance will be adjusted up or down based on the Spot
Rate applicable for the invoice date of each such Billing Event (the “FX Adjustment”) to establish an updated USD Total
Capacity Balance. For clarity, Customer’s actual consumption percentage against the USD Total Capacity Balance will
move up or down as a result of each FX Adjustment.
e. Customer’s consumption will be drawn against the USD Total Capacity Balance (subject to any FX Adjustment, as
applicable).

For clarity, any Capacity Credit Price and Capacity Storage Price set forth in the Order Form are for illustrative purposes only. If the Capacity Credit Price
and Capacity Storage Price were set forth in the Order Form in EUR, Customer may reference the applicable EUR pricing available at
https://www.snowflake.com/legal-files/CreditConsumptionTableEUR.pdf, which shall apply for the remainder of Customer’s then-current Subscription Term.
For the avoidance of doubt, the above terms apply whether Capacity is purchased directly from Snowflake or through a Snowflake-authorized reseller. For
Order Forms (including Underlying Order Forms) placed through resellers, the date of the “Billing Event,” “Processing Date” and/or “FX Adjustment” will be
determined based on the date that the reseller is billed or places the corresponding order, as applicable.
Changes to this Snowflake Service Consumption Table. This Snowflake Service Consumption Table may be updated from time to time. Changes shall
be effective on the date that Snowflake announces they are effective. This Snowflake Service Consumption Table applies to Previews, provided that
Previews may be subject to different pricing, as may be set forth in the applicable Documentation.
Any capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Agreement or the Documentation, as applicable.
21 The “Spot Rate” means the real-time currency conversion spot rate existing in the United States as reported by Oanda.com (or such other reputable
foreign exchange rate platform Snowflake may use in its sole discretion).
22 The “Processing Date” means the later of: (a) the Subscription Term Start Date or the (b) the date the Order Form is processed by Snowflake.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Additional Capacity Order will have the same Processing Date as the Underlying Order Form.
